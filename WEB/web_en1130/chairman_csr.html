            <p>Since its establishment, Makalot Industrial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, "Makalot" or "the Company") has
              upheld the corporate values of integrity, teamwork, and sharing. The Company continues to develop in a
              focused and practical attitude. The Company also considers ways to make a social contribution and fulfill
              its corporate responsibilities at the same time. Therefore, aside from expanding the corporate social
              responsibility (CSR) task force into a cross-departmental collaborative committee, Makalot commissioned
              professional consulting firms in 2016 to provide assistance with the adoption of the Global Reporting
              Initiative (GRI) standards launched by the GRI. The Company will shoulder more responsibilities where
              sustainable development is concerned on top of full disclosure of its CSR achievements.</p>

        <p>Makalot has focused on its core business (clothing development and production) since its incorporation.<br>
          Makalot is moving aggressively towards upstream vertical integration in recent years and strives to
          continuously improve performance and profitability through various innovative operation models and strategic
          planning. Makalot keeps a close watch on the changes in the global market in order to properly respond to
          potential internal and external risks. It also enhances its financial transparency, refines information
          disclosure and implements internal audit and control.</p>

        <p>Global warming is a worldwide concern. Makalot takes actions to preserve the natural environment of Taiwan.
          Since 2016, Makalot has collaborated with the Tse-Xin Organic Agriculture Foundation on the "Three-year
          Coastal Trees Adoption Plan" in the Taisi coastal resort area. Makalot employees take part by building wooden
          frames to support the seedlings of seashore plants, such as Casuarina, in order to increase their survival
          rates. We also use this opportunity to rebuild the coastal vegetationas a natural barrier and restore soil
          fertility.</p>

        <p>“Professional management and giving a sense of belonging to our employees” has been our mission since
          inception. We strive to achieve the goal of building a friendly workplace with a healthy, positive and LOHAS
          atmosphere. As a result, we moved into a new headquarters in 2016 so that employees can enjoy a more advanced
          and comfortable work environment.</p>

          <span class="S-title"><i class="icon-dot"></i>Social Welfare: Makalot Spreads Love and Motivates All</span>
        </div>

        <p>Makalot initiated its course on public welfare in 2017. Departments take turns hosting charitable events and
          organizing activities based on the three goals: “Talent education”, and “Social care”. All employees are
          called on to participate.</p>


        <p>“Talent education”: Makalot established the “Makalot Humanities Development and Education Foundation”, which
          works towards contributing to society, promoting industrial innovation, nurturing talents and fostering
          industry-academia collaboration. It also teams up with domestic colleges and universities to provide summer
          internships, sponsor research and development programs, and arrange for Company managers to give lectures at
          those universities and share their valuable professional and workplace experience. Furthermore, Makalot has
          partnered with our renowned brand customer GAP to execute the education program, Personal Advancement and
          Career Enhancement (P. A. C. E.), at overseas business locations for female employees to forge a better life
          through learning. The program is currently implemented at our overseas business locations in Indonesia,
          Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
