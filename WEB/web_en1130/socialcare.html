              <p>2017 is a specifically meaningful year when Makalot encouraged every department to take turns in
                hosting a charity event, allowing more employees to have the opportunity to participate in charity, so
                as to understand the idea of it is more blessed to give than to receive. Makalot cooperated with the
                following charity groups and held 16 activities. While Makalot volunteers paid a lot of effort when
                they attended the voluntary activities, they could feel so much about love and gain a lot when serving
                for the people who need help. </p>

              <p>Makalot and employees join together to adopt children from domestic and overseas disadvantaged
                families, and provide every child NT$700 to NT$1,000 on a monthly basis. To offer more quality
                assistance to these families, the Company would subsidize half of the donation when employees take part
                in the adoption. Makalot employees who are interested in sponsoring children from disadvantaged
                families need not make remittance arrangements. The Company would deduct the donation amount directly
                from salaries, providing a convenient approach for employees to take part in charity.

              </div>
              <p>Makalot has cooperated with CCSA for a long time and arranged volunteer activities to interact with
                children in CCSA, hoping to encourage and care for them through those activities. In 2016, Makalot
                employees volunteered to take children of Lohas Preschool to participate in environmental protection
                activities organized by SOW. We are deeply aware that the cooperation with the children’s home must be
                cultivated. Therefore, the Lohas Preschool will be a Makalot’s long-term partner in the future. In
                2017, to help children understand the importance of self-reliance in their future, the Preschool and
                Makalot organized the “Growing up Happily with Makalot” program where volunteers organized one-day trip
                with the children. During the process, the children interacted with volunteers by discussing activity
                details and learned how to arrange, communicate and execute tasks. We hope that the sense of
                achievement from those trips would give children more confidence and courage in actively exploring the
                outside world, and thus have a smooth transition into the society.</p>

                always participated with enthusiasm. The amount of blood donated has hit record high several times.</p>

                to the abovementioned employees and their families in October, which is set to be the month of caring.
                In addition, the factory provides consumer durables (e.g. TVs/washing machines, etc.) equivalent to VND
