                </div>
                <p>Makalot conducts research and analysis on the myriad needs of our clients’ labels and apparel via its various professional departments. It also acquires up-to-date fashion trends from Europe and the United States and provides the latest, most adequate fabric and trimmings to the clients. In addition to developing new fabrics and trimmings, Makalot also studies the market and the latest materials, as well as searches for adequate suppliers to satisfy the massive demands of our clients during initial development and order placement. Makalot also actively engages in the research of the individual advantages of each raw material production region to establish the positioning of materials and attain complementary benefits.</p>

                    <span class="S-title"><i class="icon-dot"></i>Efficient Development</span>
                </div>
                <p>In order to achieve rapid development and deliveries, Makalot concentrates fabric and trimmings development areas in Asia. Therefore, Makalot actively provides clients with the latest, most accurate information and delivers better service quality and efficiency. This allows Makalot to gain control over the four crucial elements - trend, quality, cost and speed. Since 2009, Makalot has been eagerly extending fabric supply chain into Indonesia and Vietnam, in order to integrate fabric supply and garment manufacturing on the timely and flexible basis. In the future, Makalot will keep enhancing the material sourcing and transforming capabilities. Makalot will also accelerate the speed of its service to satisfy client requirements in different product lines and ultimately reap the maximum benefit for the clients.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In addition to developing fabrics and trimmings, Makalot strives to select honest suppliers with stringent quality control. Makalot always conveys the quality policies and demands of its clients to all the suppliers. This ensures that when the product is delivered, both parties are satisfied with the quality and price, and there is a three-win benefit – for clients, suppliers and Makalot. The company makes regular appraisals of its fabric and trimming suppliers. Suppliers with poor service, products of inferior quality or inadequate prices are eliminated and new suppliers are introduced to fulfill the needs for growth. At the same time, in line with the awareness of sustainable environment, suppliers of Makalot are also required to achieve relevant environmental certification. Makalot and its suppliers work together to develop and promote green materials, to protect the environment and resources, and to fulfill corporate social responsibility. </p>
                <p> The collaboration between Makalot and its suppliers is based on the premises of “fulfilling customer needs” and “long-term cooperative partnerships”. The choice of Makalot’s suppliers is based on the policy of having good R&D and manufacturing capabilities and the most global presence, so that Makalot can respond to the dynamically changing fashion apparel market.
